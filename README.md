Problem Statement :
Enhancing City Infrastructure with Data-Driven Decisions
• Cities generate massive data every day from traffic sensors, service requests, citizen complaints, and air quality monitors.
• These datasets is often siloed and underutilized, making it difficult for city planners to respond quickly or plan ahead.

Our Idea:
Build a unified data platform on Snowflake that can:
• Ingest multi-source city data into a central repository.
• Clean and combine these datasets to create a single source of truth.
• Use Streams & Tasks for near real-time updates and automated data processing.
• Provide dashboards (Streamlit / Snowsight) to give planners live visibility.
• Extend with ML models to predict infrastructure failures (like potholes or streetlights)

 Outcome:
• Identify traffic congestion hotspots from live traffic data.
• Predict risk of infrastructure failures (e.g., potholes, faulty streetlights) using historical patterns.
• Improve service response times by prioritizing complaints and incidents.
• Provide live dashboards with geospatial views for planners to monitor and act quickly
